## Summary
Implemented Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) features to improve visibility on AI platforms. This includes adding `robots.txt` and `llms.txt` configuration files, and injecting structured data (LD-JSON) schemas into the application layouts.

## Changes
- **SEO & AI Optimization**:
    - Created `public/robots.txt` allowing access for major AI bots (GPTBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, etc.).
    - Created `public/llms.txt` to provide a concise site summary and key links for AI crawlers.
    - Implemented LD-JSON structured data schemas:
        - `SoftwareApplication` (Zen Analytics)
        - `FAQPage`
        - `Organization`
        - `Person`
    - Injected schemas into `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` and `src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`.

- **Refactoring**:
    - Extracted FAQ data to `src/utils/faq-items.ts` for reusability between UI and Schema.
    - Updated `src/components/sections/FAQ.tsx` to consume the shared FAQ data.
    - Expanded `src/utils/faq-items.ts` from 5 to 20 detailed, SEO-optimized questions covering technical capabilities, platform support, and privacy.
    - Created `src/utils/schemas.ts` to centralize schema definitions.

## Impact
- **Small**: No visual changes to the UI. Changes are primarily for search engines and AI agents.
- **Low Risk**: Standard static file additions and metadata injection.
