# Dominant Neutrals: The palette relies heavily on neutral colors.

White: Used extensively for the main background, providing a clean and spacious feel.
Light Grey: A very light grey is used for the background of the feature cards, creating subtle separation from the main white background. Another slightly darker grey is used for the secondary "Learn More" button.
Black/Dark Grey: Used for the main heading text ("WXT", feature titles) and body copy, ensuring high readability against the light backgrounds.
Primary Accent Color:

Bright Green: This is the most prominent accent color. It's used strategically for:
The logo element (puzzle piece).
The primary Call-to-Action button ("Get Started").
Some icons (like the checkmark).
Links within the text content. This green provides vibrancy, draws attention to key elements, and likely serves as the core brand identifier.
Subtle Tertiary Accents:

Light Tan/Desaturated Orange: Some of the icons within the feature cards seem to use a very light, almost pastel tan or desaturated orange hue as their background fill, adding a touch of warmth without competing with the main green accent.
Overall Impression:

The color palette is clean, modern, and minimalist, typical of tech or developer-focused websites. It prioritizes clarity and readability through high contrast between text and backgrounds. The dominant use of white space makes the interface feel uncluttered. The strategic use of the bright green accent color effectively draws the eye to interactive elements and branding, creating a fresh and energetic feel without overwhelming the user.

Consistency is Key: The core palette identified previously remains consistent:

Neutrals Dominant: White for the main content background, light grey for the sidebar and code blocks/info boxes, black/dark grey for text.
Green as Primary Accent: The same bright green is used consistently for links within the text, the active navigation item highlight in the sidebar ("Installation"), and even within code examples (pnpm, wxt). This reinforces its role as the primary interactive and brand color.

Functional Application: This page shows how the palette is applied functionally in a documentation context:

Navigation: Green clearly indicates the current page in the sidebar and distinguishes clickable links. Different shades of grey differentiate active/inactive tabs (PNPM/Bun/etc.) and sidebar links.

Readability Focus: The palette choices continue to prioritize readability, which is essential for documentation. The high contrast between the dark text and light backgrounds ensures text is easy to scan and read.

The palette is very effective in creating a clear visual hierarchy. Headings, body text, links, code blocks, and navigation elements are all clearly delineated through color, background, and typography.
The overall impression remains clean, modern, and developer-focused. The consistent application across different page types (homepage vs. documentation) shows a well-defined visual identity.
In summary, this second page confirms the palette identified earlier (White/Light Grey/Dark Text + Bright Green Accent) and demonstrates its effective and consistent application for informational and navigational purposes within the web app's documentation.
