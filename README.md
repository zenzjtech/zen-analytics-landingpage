# Zen Analytics Pixel Tracker

This repository contains the source code for the landing page of Zen Analytics Pixel Tracker, a Chrome extension that aggregates data from 20+ trackers into a unified interface within your browser. Note that this is not the extension itself, but rather the promotional [website](https://zen-analytics-pixel-tracker.web.app/) for it.

## Product Description

For those involved in managing digital advertising and analytics, verifying tracking implementations across various platforms is often a necessary task. Utilizing multiple pixel helper extensions and GA debug views to monitor Google Tag Manager, Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, GA4, and other systems can present efficiency challenges, particularly during the deployment of new campaigns or website features.

To address this challenge, a Chrome extension called Zen Analytics Pixel Tracker has been developed. This tool aggregates data from 25+ trackers into a unified interface within the user's browser.
